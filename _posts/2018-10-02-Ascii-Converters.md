    <td>I could've reflected what was said in the lesson, and maybe asked Mr Keen what functions an Ascii converter would have in the world of computing aside from converting the keyboard into numbers.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will attempt to use all of my learning habits next lesson, especially trying to reflect and question what Mr Keen says. I will also try to go above and beyond with my next projects so I can show that I use positive habits.</td>
