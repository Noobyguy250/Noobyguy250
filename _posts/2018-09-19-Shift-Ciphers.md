    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used the same techniques that Mr Keen did to work on my blog.</td>

    <td>I could've tried harder to get more code down so that the entire exercise could be completed. I also could have saved time by not talking to others about pointless other topics.</td>

    <td>I should attempt to get more done in a lesson to make sure I reinforce the concept into my head, as it may come in handy in later life. I should also try my best not to get distracted by others so that I can hopefully achieve more.</td>
